Leaflet Map Split Viewer
==================

A Leaflet-powered version of my Google Maps Split Viewer.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Until I figure out a way to disable Leaflet's built in panning animation, this may simply serve as proof this is possible to do. The animation prevents transitions from happening smoothly. But hey, it kinda works!
